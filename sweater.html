      <p>It was the <strong>first</strong> day of October. I was wearing my <strong>blue</strong> sweater, you know the one I bought at <strong>Dillardâ€™s?</strong> The one with a double knitted <strong>hem</strong> and <strong>holes</strong> in the <strong>ends</strong> of the <strong>sleeves</strong> that <strong>I</strong> could poke my <strong>thumbs</strong> through when it was cold but I didn't feel like wearing <strong>gloves?</strong> It was the <strong>same</strong> sweater you said made my <strong>eyes</strong>
      look like reflections of the <strong>stars</strong> on the <strong>ocean.</strong></p>
      <p>You promised to love me <strong>forever</strong> that night...</p>
      <p>and <strong>boy</strong></p>
      <p>did <strong>you</strong></p>
      <p><strong>ever!</strong></p>
