    <h1>Pink Balloon</h1>
    <div>
      <p>“My name is Olivia King</p>
      <p>I am five years old.</p>
      <p>My mother bought me a balloon. I remember the day she walked through the front door with it. The curly hot pink ribbon <strong>trickling</strong> down her arm, <strong>wrapped</strong> around her <strong>wrist.</strong> She was smiling at me as she <strong>untied</strong> the ribbon and wrapped it around my hand.</p>
      <p>“Here Livie, I bought this for you.”</p>
      <p>She called me <em>Livie.</em></p>
      <p>I was so <strong>happy.</strong> I’d<strong>never</strong> had a <strong>balloon</strong> before. I mean, I always saw balloons wrapped around <strong>other</strong> kids wrists in the
      parking lot of <strong>Wal-Mart,</strong> but I never <strong>dreamed</strong> I would have my very <strong>own.</strong></p>
      <p>My <strong>very own</strong> pink balloon.</p>
      <p>I was <strong>excited!</strong> So <strong>ecstatic!</strong> So
      <strong>thrilled!</strong> I couldn't believe my mother bought me something! She'd <strong>never</strong> bought me <strong>anything</strong>
      before! I played with it for <strong>hours.</strong> It was full of
      <strong>helium</strong> and it <strong>danced</strong> and
      <strong>swayed</strong> and <strong>floated</strong> as I
      <strong>drug</strong> it around from <strong>room</strong> to
      <strong>room</strong> with me, thinking of places to take it. Thinking of places the balloon had <strong>never</strong> been before. I took it in the
      <strong>bathroom,</strong> the <strong>closet,</strong> the
      <strong>laundry room,</strong> the <strong>kitchen,</strong> the
      <strong>living room.</strong> I wanted my new best friend to see
      <strong>everything</strong> I saw! I took it to my mother's
      <strong>bedroom!</strong></p>
      <p>My mothers</p>
      <p>Bedroom?</p>
      <p>Where I wasn't supposed to be?</p>
      <p>With my pink</p>
      <p><em>balloon...</em></p>
      <p>I <strong>covered</strong> my ears as she <strong>screamed</strong>
      at me, <strong>wiping</strong> the <strong>evidence</strong> off her
      <strong>nose!</strong> She <strong>slapped</strong> me across the face as she told me how <strong>bad</strong> I was! How much I <strong>misbehaved!</strong> How I never <strong>listened!</strong> She
      <strong>shoved</strong> me into the hallways and <strong>slammed</strong>
      the door, locking my pink balloon inside with her. I wanted him
      <strong>back!</strong> He was <strong>my</strong> best friend! <strong>Not her!</strong> The pink ribbon was <strong>still</strong> tied around my wrist so I <strong>pulled</strong> and <strong>pulled,</strong> trying to get my new best friend <strong>away</strong> from her.</p>
      <p>And</p>
      <p>it</p>
      <p><em>popped.</em></p>
      <p>My name is Eddie.</p>
      <p>I'm seventeen years old.</p>
      <p>My <em>birthday</em> is next week. I'll be big <em>One-Eight.</em> My foster dad is buying me these boots I've been wanting. I'm sure my friends will take me out to eat. My boyfriend will buy me a <em>gift,</em> maybe even take me to a <em>movie.</em> I'll even get a nice little card from my foster care worker, wishing me a happy eighteenth birthday, informing me I've aged out of the <em>system.</em></p>
      <p>I'll have a good time. I know I will.</p>
      <p>But there's <strong>one</strong> thing I know</p>
      <p>for <strong>sure</strong></p>
      <p>I better not get any</p>
      <p><strong>shitty ass pink balloons!”</strong></p>
